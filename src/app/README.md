Setup instructions
Install bootstrap, ng2search, fontawesome

How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your application?

Visuals: I decided to use Bootstrap as I'd like to maintain a clean interface, considering that the websites main focus should be the clothing item itself.

Angular: Mainly to take advantage of property, data and two-way binding, and also directives such as ngFor

What would you change about the project if you had more time.
- Implement more funcionalities and search filters, such as: 

Possibility to combine multiple items together into one "folder" AKA outfit 

Instead of the name of the color written on the detail page, a round icon filled with that color 

Filters: Filtering items per color
